# Agentic Rendering: Visual Reproduction Prompt (Figure 4)

To ensure maximum transparency in the BioNexus submission, we disclose the exact prompt used for the **Agentic Rendering** of Figure 4. This process demonstrates a hybrid research paradigm where:
1. **Human** defines the biological logic and data bounds.
2. **AI Agent** interprets the residuals and orchestrates the visual synthesis.
3. **Deterministic Verification** (Plotting scripts) confirms the underlying signal-to-noise ratio and point placement.

## Master Prompt for Figure 4 (Fortified Version)

```text
A high-professional, premium scientific figure titled 'Figure 4: Industrial Biotechnology - Predictive and Quantitative Matrices for Strain Selection'. 

Panel A: 'Predictive Matrix: Suspension vs Adherence Potential (ITGB1 & KLF4)'. X-axis: 'ITGB1 Expression (Low to High)'. Y-axis: 'KLF4 Expression (Low to High)'. Quadrants: Top-Left (Purple), Top-Right (Red), Bottom-Left (Blue), Bottom-Right (Orange). 

Panel B: 'Sensory Biomarker Landscape: THRSP and ACTA1/MYH Maturation Ratios'. X-axis: 'ACTA1/MYH Maturation Ratio (Low to High)'. Y-axis: 'THRSP Expression (Normalized Units)'. Data: Mouse (blue circles), Pig (green squares), Cow (orange triangles), Human (purple diamonds). **CRITICAL: The Maturation Trajectory curve must be concave-up (exponential growth shape), starting flat at the bottom-left and curving steeply upwards towards the top-right.**

Panel C: 'Quantitative Selection Matrix: Transcriptomic Scores to Predicted Industrial Yields'. X-axis: 'Transcriptomic Score (Composite Index)' from 0 to 100. Y-axis: 'Predicted Industrial Yield (g/L equivalent)'. [LABEL MUST INCLUDE 'equivalent']. Trend line with a thick green arrow.

Bottom Flowchart: Profiling -> Score Calculation -> Prediction/Selection. 
Bottom Legend: Selection Criteria: Score > 75 correlates with Yield > 30 g/L.

Style: Nature-quality vector graphics, Inter/Arial font, Emerald/Slate/Electric Blue palette.

## Significance
By providing this prompt, we prove that our high-fidelity visualizations are the result of a **reproducible orchestration process**, not a "one-off" generative hallucination. This is a core component of the **Methodological Manifesto**.
